# data-structure-final-task
### Final task for data structure in Telkom University

This final task made using C++. Read C++ basic guide [here](https://github.com/BrotherCode1/Struktur-Data-dalam-CPP/blob/master/C%2B%2B%20Basic.md) and [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/).

### Compiling and running C++
For Windows users, you may need to [install MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) first.
If you are using IDEs such as Code::Blocks, DevC++, you may need to set up things. Then you can do all of the rest there.
If not, you can compile in Terminal/Command Prompt.
For Windows:
```
	g++ source_code_file_name -o output_file_name.exe
```
For Linux:
```
	g++ source_code_file_name -o output_file_name
```
